#PlanarBinding
##What's this?
This is a mod I'm working on, focusing around the idea of binding elementals and outsiders to things, and eventually summoning them for other purposes, using large, multiblock summoning circles.  At the moment, it is still in very early development.

I'm still pretty new at modding and somewhat of an amatuer at coding in general, so (constructive) criticism is more than welcome!

##License
I've found referencing and studying other's open source code to be immensely helpful in learning how to mod.  I feel no reason at all to prevent others from using my code for the same purposes, or most anything else.  Feel free to copy it, fork it, use it, or whatever.
